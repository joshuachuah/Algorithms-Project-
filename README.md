# Algorithms-Project-
Project for Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms. Implementing different large multiplication algorithms and testing them to see which one works fastest. 
Comparing the time complexity between the standard multiplication method, Karatsuba's Algorithm, and the Divide and Conquer method.
